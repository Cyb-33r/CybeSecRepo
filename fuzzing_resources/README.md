# Fuzzing Resources

**Fuzz testing**, or **fuzzing**, is a technique that can be used to find software errors (or bugs) and security vulnerabilities in applications, operating systems, infrastructure devices, IoT devices, and other computing device. Fuzzing involves sending random data to the unit being tested in order to find input validation issues, program failures, buffer overflows, and other flaws.

## Community-supported/Open Source Fuzzers

* **Peach** is one of the most popular fuzzers in the industry. There is a free (open source) version, the Peach Fuzzer Community Edition, and a commercial version. You can download the Peach Fuzzer Community Edition and obtain additional information about the commercial version at [http://www.peach.tech/resources/peachcommunity/](http://www.peach.tech/resources/peachcommunity/). The CompTIA PenTest+ exam does not require you to be an expert with Peach. However, if you would like to obtain more information about Peach and access several tutorials and examples, visit [http://community.peachfuzzer.com/WhatIsPeach.html](http://community.peachfuzzer.com/WhatIsPeach.html).
* The **Mutiny Fuzzing Framework** is an open source fuzzer created by Cisco. It works by replaying packet capture files (pcaps) through a mutational fuzzer. You can download and obtain more information about Mutiny Fuzzing Framework at [Munity Fuzzer](https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/mutiny-fuzzer). The Mutiny Fuzzing Framework uses Radamsa to perform mutations. Radamsa is a tool that can be used to generate test cases for fuzzers. You can download and obtain additional information about Radamsa at [https://gitlab.com/akihe/radamsa](https://gitlab.com/akihe/radamsa).
