## Bash shell, Python, Ruby, and PowerShell

Two of the best ways to become familiar with these languages are by creating your own scripts and inspecting scripts created by others. You can easily find scripts to inspect by navigating through GitHub and even looking at exploit code in the Exploit Database, at [https://www.exploit-db.com](https://www.exploit-db.com).


### Bash Shell

Bash is a command shell and language interpreter that is available for operating systems such as Linux, Mac OS X, and even Windows. The name bash is an acronym for the Bourne-Again shell. A shell is command-line tool that allows for interactive or non-interactive command execution. Having a good background in bash enables you to quickly create scripts, parse data, and automate different tasks and can be helpful in penetration testing engagements.

The following websites provides examples of bash scripting concepts, tutorials, examples, and cheat sheets:

- DevHints bash shell programming cheat sheet: [https://devhints.io/bash](https://devhints.io/bash)


### Python

Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the industry. It can be used to automate repetitive tasks and create sophisticated applications, and it can also be used in penetration testing.

### Ruby

Ruby is another programming language that is used in many web and other types of applications. 
The Metasploit exploitation framework was created in Ruby, and it also comes with source code for exploits, modules, and scripts created in Ruby. Itâ€™s a good idea to download Kali Linux or another penetration testing distribution and become familiar with the scripts and exploits that come with Metasploit. This will help you familiarize yourself with the structure of Ruby scripts.

### PowerShell

Throughout this book, you have learned that PowerShell and related tools can be used for exploitation and post-exploitation activities. Microsoft has a vast collection of free video courses and tutorials that include PowerShell at the Microsoft Virtual Academy (see [https://mva.microsoft.com](https://mva.microsoft.com) or [https://mva.microsoft.com/training-topics/powershell](https://mva.microsoft.com/training-topics/powershell)).
